    "\n",
    "When I first heard of Twitter way back when I thought it was stupid. I mean, who would really want to put their thoughts (in 140 or fewer characters) out for the world to see? \n",
    "\n",
    "Apparently, a lot of people...\n",
    "\n",
    "It has only been in the past six months or so that I've come to use Twitter regularly. However, I don't tweet all that much, so what's the point? Information curation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Twitter has given me virtual access to experts in the fields of data science, machine learning and deep learning. The list of names is exceptionally long, but all these individuals combine to help show the way, so to speak. They highlight the signal within all the noise around the above subjects. Additionally, **I** have the choice in whose information I allow to populate the screen of my smartphone or laptop. In summary, much like an art connoisseur curates artworks for a showing, I can curate what information populates my feed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now there are issues with this, the most obvious of which is that one can begin to silo themselves into a bubble. Since we have the power to control our feed, and for the most part, many of us want to read about what we're already interested in, why would we be compelled to follow anybody with completely opposite views? \n",
    "\n",
    "However, I don't want to get too far into the weeds because this notebook has a different and very specific purpose. Continuing with the #trend, we're going to look into gathering tweets from Twitter and analyzing them using Python. More specifically, we're going to be focusing on the tweets from members of the United States federal government - particularly those in the Legislative and Executive Branches - where we'll use a range of NLP (natural language processing) techniques to analyze the sentiment associated with each tweet. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, I want to get a better understanding of Twitter's [API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs). Ever since I went through Dataquest's [tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/streaming-data-python/) on the Twitter API, I've made it a focus to get more comfortable with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an extension, I want to expand my understanding of the wide range of tools available in Python for NLP (natural-language processing). When I first started my journey into data science, I was hugely intimidated by working with text. After all, how do you analyze anything but numbers? Luckily, I've been exposed to some really insightful resources (which I'll list below) that have really helped me to grasp the many approaches available to us with NLP. \n",
    "\n",
    "I feel like I'm starting to ramble, so without further ado, let's dive in! Our first step will be making sure `tweepy` is installed in our environment.\n",

    "### _What is `tweepy`?_\n",
    "\n",
    "_\"An easy-to-use Python library for accessing the Twitter API.\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "Couldn't put it more succinctly than that. Like `sklearn` does for machine learning, or `pandas` does for data wrangling, `tweepy` gives us tools to work directly with and access information on Twitter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can analyze tweets though we need to set up an app via Twitter's developer site. While I won't be diving further into this initial app set-up, Dataquest's [tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/streaming-data-python/) gives an excellent high-level overview of how to do this. \n",
    "\n",
    "So after setting up our app, we have access to an assortment of \"Keys and Access Tokens\". Much like the press need badges to get into White House press meetings, these keys/tokens are the credentials that allow us to access Twitter. I want to highlight here the importance of keeping these _private_. If someone else had these keys/tokens, they could access Twitter and potentially do some nefarious acts in your name, which we don't want! \n",
    "\n",
    "To better keep these key/variables private, they'll be stored as variables in a private Python script. We'll then be able to call to each key/token directly without directly having to put actual combinations in. For clarification, though, below is some background on the different keys/tokens and what variables they'll be stored in.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consumer Key (i.e., API Key) - will be stored in a variable called `TWITTER_API_KEY`\n",
    "- Consumer Secret (i.e., API Secret Key) - will be stored in a variable called `TWITTER_API_SECRET`\n",
    "- Access Token - will be stored in a variable called `TWITTER_TOKEN`\n",
    "- Access Token Secret - will be stored in a variable called `TWITTER_TOKEN_SECRET`\n",
    "\n",
    "### _Setting Up the Environment_\n",
    "\n",
    "With all this talk about `tweepy`, I nearly forgot about one crucial step: setting up my working environment! Since I only had access to an older Macbook for this project, I'll be using Google Colab today which means to access any of the scripts I mentioned previously, I'll have to \"mount\" this Colab notebook to my Google Drive. After that, I'll update the main directory to the correct location; this will serve as our \"home base,\" where any data we access (or decide to download) will be stored. It takes just a few steps, so let's do that now.\n"

Luckily this step was pretty quick; after a quick Google search, I came across David Yanofsky's Python script ([link](https://gist.github.com/yanofsky/5436496)) that did most of the leg work. I made a few slight tweaks to it for this project, but David did most of the leg work, so thank you! \n",

    "We can see that by calling `info()`, we're able to get a good high-level overview of what is in each column. It looks like we're working with `int` and `object` data types. (FYI - `object` means strings).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now might be an excellent time to take a step back and assess what happened when we accessed the tweets with our `get_tweets` function and what was returned from the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access Donald Trump's tweets, we use what is called a `Cursor` object. Now, what is it? Well, when we use the Twitter API, we inevitably run into something called [pagination](http://docs.tweepy.org/en/v3.4.0/cursor_tutorial.html). In other words, we are often going to have to iterate over things to get the information we want. For example, the `get_tweets` iterates through `realDonaldTrump`'s timeline until it has gathered the number of tweets specified. \n",
    "\n",
    "What the `Cursor` does is simplify this iteration. Instead of a combination of `if-else` statements and `for` loops, we simply pass in the username! \n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, that's cool and all, but how do we go about collecting the actual tweets?\n",
    "\n",
    "The data returned from the API is called a Tweet object (really original...). Within this object, there is a long list of ‘root-level’ attributes, including fundamental attributes such as `id`, `created_at`, and `text`. ([source](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/data-dictionary/overview/tweet-object))\n",
    "\n",
    "For reference, I've decided to describe what each column represents below. I'll present the column name, then its subsequent description, data type and the Tweet object `Attribute` name (all of which can also be found at this [link](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/data-dictionary/overview/tweet-object)):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `username`: Twitter username/handle of individual of interest; in our function we technically used the username that was input in the `get_tweets` function; this could be accessed however by calling `user`, which returns a [User object](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/data-dictionary/overview/user-object) that is also a data dictionary containing assorted data about the user \n",
    "- `id`: the unique identifier of the tweet, the root-level attribute name is `id_str`, which returns a string; there is technically another attribute that returns the same thing, but as an `int` however, Twitter advises using the string version to be on the safe side\n",
    "- `created_at`: UTC time when Tweet was created, the root-level attribute name is also `created_at` which returns a string type\n",
    "- `source`: utility used to post the tweet, i.e. 'did you use your smartphone or computer/laptop to post it?', the root-level attribute name is also `source` which returns a string type\n",
    "- `retweet_count`: number of times tweet has been retweeted, the root-level attribute name is `retweet-count` which returns an integer type\n",
    "- `favorite_count`: approximately how many times the tweet's been liked by other users, the root-level attribute name is also `favorite_count` which returns an integer type\n",
    "- `tweet`: the actual text of the tweet, the root-level attribute name is `text` which returns a string type\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see though, there is a mismatch between the columns and their types, the most obvious being the `id` column. Despite us retrieving the `id_str` attribute from the Tweet object, `pandas` saw the numbers and implied that it should be an `int` type instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily we can fix this as the `read_csv()` function has a way for us to define data types for each column by inputting a dictionary into the `dtype` parameter. Let's go ahead and create this dictionary and then pass it into the CSV function again! After all, third time is a charm!"
